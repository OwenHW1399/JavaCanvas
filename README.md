# Online Java Drawing Board
## **Removing the main branch which was too simplistic, a new version is under development and will be updated soon!**
The new version will convert the drawing board into a pattern recognition software by adding a python software with GUI that will take a image imported from Graphics2d drawing, and apply a computer vision algorithm on the image. \

## Old Version's README
This is a drawing board written in Java. The user is capable of selecting filling and stroke color from a palate and adjusting the thickness and transparency of the stroke and lines using a slide bar. The user can draw straight lines, curves, rectangle and ellipses with the thickness, color and transparency he/she set before. \
